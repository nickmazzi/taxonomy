Other WPC staff and volunteers will be appointed to specific functional areas within the management and leadership of the NCL, such as operations, logistics and procurement, communication and marketing, and participant (athlete, coach, official) development. WPC will be responsible for establishing partnerships with local hospitality groups and establishing preferred hotel rates and other travel and accommodations concessions for participating teams. WPC is responsible for establishing a “stay and play” and “travel and play” policy for participating teams and for providing each host club (or PSO) with a hosting kit, including marketing materials and officials’ uniforms.

.

* 1.2.1 The NCL Council Steering Team's mandate is to help create, evaluate, review, and implement all technical aspects of the NCL for the various age categories (16 and under, 18 and under, and Senior). The Terms of Reference for this committee can be found in Appendix A.

* 1.2.2 The Discipline Committee’s mandate is to provide guidance and implement disciplinary standards for all competition-related matters and review behaviour deemed detrimental to the league's image or contrary to the WPC Code of Conduct and as defined in the Judiciary for all NCL age categories. The Terms of Reference for this committee can be found in Appendix B.

* 1.2.3 The National Technical Official (NTO) Committee is responsible for scheduling referees and delegates for all NCL games and providing onsite leadership support, when deemed necessary. There will be an NTO Chair and Two Coordinators: one responsible for the western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) and another for the eastern provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Atlantic Canada). A fourth representative may be recruited to support committee duties at special events. The NTO Committee can assign, evaluate, mentor, and discipline referees and, when need arises, support WPC in communicating disciplinary sanctions.

* 1.2.4 A Local Organizing Committee (LOC) will be formed for each of the Championships events: 16U Western Finals, 16U Eastern Finals; 18U Conference Championships, Senior Nationals; and the 18 and under National Finals. Members of the local club, municipal tourism departments and Province will be asked to sit on the LOC along with the assigned WPC staff members. The LOC will be responsible for organizing these events.

* 1.2.5 The host club is responsible for all the following during NCL games:

* 1.2.5.1 Ensure all timing equipment can deliver programming for the 20s shot clock.

* 1.2.5.2 Minor officials are provided for each field of play, including a game secretary (6-8 sports), shot clock/game clock worker, penalty secretary, minor officials supervisor, and live stream operator.

* 1.2.5.3 Setup/takedown of the field of play for all games completed an hour before first game time.

* 1.2.5.4 The host club will be responsible for a hospitality suite for the volunteers, coaches, and officials for competition events of more than 6 hours per day. For any NCL Finals event, Water Polo Canada will provide $100 per meal per field of play.

* 1.2.5.8 If the LOC fails to adhere to any of the responsibilities listed above WPC may deliver a fine or determine the LOC ineligible for hosting future NCL events.

* 1.2.6 The NCL has a stay-and-play policy for all categories. All clubs in the NCL will be expected to stay at WPC partner hotels for all NCL events where a host partner exists. The hotel partners will be listed on the WPC site. Any club that reserves rooms at a non-partner hotel will violate the policy. Violation of the stay-and-play policy will result in the club paying fines of $750 per team for regular season violations and $1000 per team for Finals events violations.

Athlete attire must be blank or contain the club’s logo or club/team name. Athletes can wear different versions of attire (i.e., swimsuits) if the design and major colour schemes of the attire remain the same (ex., suits must have the same base colour, but if the logo switches from the left side to the right side, that is acceptable). WPC/National Team clothing, or clothing from another country, is prohibited. The uniform standard applies to opening ceremonies, pre/during/post-games, and awards ceremonies.

* 2.2.10 All bench staff must wear similar attire, which includes the following: pants, capris, shorts, a t-shirt, a golf shirt and a dress shirt:

* 2.3.0 Players must be Canadian Citizens or Residents of Canada, or be a resident of another country who is living in Canada under an appropriate visa, and in good standing with their Club, PSO and WPC registered in the Perform in Water Polo registration category and in good standing with their Club, PSO and WPC, and must appear on the WPC Registration System.

* 2.3.2 Athletes may only appear on one (1) roster per division, per year.

* 2.3.2.1 Clubs who enter multiple teams in a single NCL division, excluding 16U (ex: two 18U boys’ teams), can move athletes between their multiple teams, under certain requirements. Each eligible team may move a maximum of four players during an NCL season. A club that has two teams entered a single category would, therefore, have a possible maximum of eight roster moves in one season, four players moving from Team A to Team B and four players moving from Team B to Team A). Eligible teams must make any roster moves before the Conference Championships or National Championships, whichever comes first.

* 2.3.3 Participants may not be listed as an athlete and coach on the same roster.

## NCL HANDBOOK 2024 - 2025

.

* 2.3.4 If an athlete's hat number does not match what is on the signed roster, the onsite Water Polo Canada delegate will change it in the 6-8 game sheet App. It is the team’s responsibility to ensure that all athletes' names are correctly spelled and cap numbers are accurate. The team will be assessed one demerit for signing an incorrect scoresheet.

* 2.3.5 If an athlete on a team’s master roster but not listed on the scoresheet, is found in the water or on the team bench, the delegate will add the missing player’s name to the scoresheet. The team will be assessed 1 demerit for signing an incorrect scoresheet.

* 2.3.6 If during a game, an athlete who is not registered on a team’s master roster and is found to be in the water, the athlete shall not be permitted to play or continue to play. If the game has started, the offending team will forfeit the game. In this scenario, an Incident Report must be written and submitted to the NTO Coordinator, Senior Manager of Leagues and Pathways and the League and Events Lead. If an ineligible athlete is found after the match ends, the game will not be replayed and the game will be considered a forfeit. The Discipline Committee will review the report to determine if suspension, fines, or another penalty should be added.

* 2.3.7 Athletes may only compete with the club with which they are registered as a primary, secondary, tertiary or fourth club member. The following exceptions will apply:

* 2.3.7.1 Senior NCL athletes, excluding Senior National Team athletes, may participate on any team provided they meet the requirements in 2.3.1. above.

* 2.3.7.2 Athletes who receive funding from their home province but wish to play for an NCL club outside of their home province because 1) they are training at the NTC and/or 2) there are no NCL clubs within their province, are eligible to apply for an exemption that will allow them to compete for a club in a different province, without having to give up their home province registration.

* 2.3.7.3 Athletes who participate in one NCL category for their home club but cannot play for their club in a 2nd NCL category because their club has not entered a team into that category can submit an exemption request to play for a club in a different province of registration (without switching their registration) if they meet all the following conditions:

•

* The athlete is playing in either the 16 and under, 18 and under NCL category for their primary, secondary, tertiary or fourth club.

## NCL HANDBOOK 2024 - 2025

.

* The athlete cannot play in either the 16 and under, 18 and under NCL category for their primary, secondary, tertiary or fourth club because their club does not offer that team.

* The athlete is unable to play in the specified NCL category for another club in their province of registration because no other club(s) has registered a team in the specified NCL category or the club(s) who have entered cannot accommodate the athlete on their team(s).

* If an athlete meets all the above conditions, they are eligible to apply for an exemption to rule 2.3.7. The exemption request must be submitted to the Senior Manager of Leagues and Pathway and the League and Events Lead and must clearly show the required conditions have been met.

* 2.3.7.4 Player Loan forms must be submitted to Senior Manager of Leagues and Pathway and the League and Events Lead prior to an athlete being eligible to compete. The WPC office will confirm once the athlete is eligible to be added to the team’s roster.

* 2.3.8 18 and under and Senior athletes must compete in at least one full event of the regular season, in more than 50% of the games, to be eligible for the respective category’s playoffs (East/West Conference Championships, National Finals, and the Senior National Championships). Extenuating circumstances may exist for injuries or other situations. The team will need to submit an official letter of appeal at least 14 days in advance of an event to the Senior Manager of Leagues and Pathway and the League and Events Lead along with supporting documentation.

* 2.3.9 Athletes training at the National Team Centre (NTC) full-time are eligible to play in the NCL. NTC athletes must have their club choice approved by the Senior National Team Staff in conjunction with the Senior Manager of Pathways and Leagues and the League and Events Lead. WPC will consider the following criteria when determining whether to accept or deny a placement for the athlete: club history of the athlete, positional need of the team, previous league placement of the team, logistics, and competitive balance. The Senior NT athletes are on loan from the NT during the Senior season, and as such, ALL NT activities will take precedence over Senior games.

## 2.4 Duration of the Game

* 2.4.0 All games of all categories shall consist of four (4) quarters of eight (8) minute stop time with a two (2) minute interval break between periods.

* 2.4.1 Stop time will be used throughout the game, unless a 10-goal differential is reached. Once a 10-goal differential is reached run time will be used for the

## NCL HANDBOOK 2024 - 2025

.

rest of the game for all situations, except with timeouts. If the timeclock and possession clock are not able to be asynchronously, then run time will be used in interval time only.

* 2.4.2 Regular season or finals events with a round-robin followed by a medal round will use World Aquatics tie-breaking procedures for any teams tied after round-robin play.

* 2.4.3 In finals events with only round-robin play, every game will require a definitive winner. Any game ending with a tied score at the end of regulation will proceed to a shootout to determine the winner. The World Aquatics shootout procedure will be applied, except that only three (3) shooters instead of five (5) will shoot according to the rules. Regular season round-robin games will end in a tie.

* 2.4.4 Elimination or qualification games during the Championship competitions (East/West Conference Championships, National Championships, Open Championships and Senior Nationals) ending with a tied score at the end of regulation will proceed to a shootout to determine the winner.
